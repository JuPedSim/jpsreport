this method calculates the density based on Voronoi diagrams, 
which are a special kind of decomposition of a metric space determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space. 

At any time the positions of the pedestrians
can be represented as a set of points, from which the Voronoi
diagram can be generated. 

The Voronoi cell area,  \\(A_i\\), for each person  \\(i\\) can be obtained. 

Then, the density and velocity distribution of the space \\(\rho_{xy} \\)  and  \\(v_{xy}\\) can be defined as

$$\rho_{xy} = 1/A_i \quad \rm{and} \quad v_{xy}={v_i(t)}\qquad \mbox{if (x,y) \in A_i},$$

where  \\(v_i(t)\\) is the instantaneous velocity of each person. 

The Voronoi density for the
measurement area is defined as:

$$\langle \rho \rangle_v=\frac{\iint{\rho_{xy}dxdy}}{b_{\rm cor}\cdot\Delta x}.$$

Similarly, the Voronoi velocity is defined as:

$$\langle v \rangle_v=\frac{\iint{v_{xy}dxdy}}{b_{\rm cor}\cdot\Delta x}.$$
