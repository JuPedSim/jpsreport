This method calculates the mean value of flow and density over time. 

A reference line is taken and studied over a
fixed period of time \\(\Delta {t}\\). 
Using this method we can obtain the pedestrian flow \\(J\\) and the 
velocity \\(v_i\\) of each pedestrian passing the reference line directly. 
Thus, the flow over time \\(\langle J \rangle_{\Delta t}\\) and the time mean 
velocity \\(\langle v \rangle_{\Delta t}\\) 
can be calculated as

$$\langle J \rangle_{\Delta t}=\frac{N_{\Delta t}}{t_N_{\Delta t} - t_1_{\Delta t}}\qquad {\rm and} \qquad \langle v \rangle_{\Delta t}=\frac{1}{N_{\Delta t}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\Delta t}} v_i(t),$$

where \\(N_{\Delta t}\\) is the number of persons passing the 
reference line during the time interval  \\(\Delta {t}\\). 

\\(t_N_{\Delta t}\\) and  \\(t_1_{\Delta t})\\ are the times when the first and last pedestrians pass the location in \\(\Delta t)\\.

Note: this time period can be different from  \\(\Delta {t}\\). 
The time mean velocity  \\(\langle v \rangle_{\Delta t}\\) 
is defined as the mean value of the
instantaneous velocities  \\(N_{\Delta t}\\) pedestrians. 
 \\(v_i(t)\\) is calculated by use of the displacement of 
 pedestrian  \\(i\\) in a small time interval  \\(\Delta t^\prime\\) around  \\(t\\):

$$v_i(t)=\frac{\vec{x_i}(t+\Delta t^\prime/2)-\vec{x_i}(t-\Delta t^\prime/2))}{\Delta t^\prime}.$$
