This method measures the mean value of velocity and density
over space and time. The spatial mean velocity and density are
calculated by taking a segment  \\(\Delta x\\) in a corridor as the
measurement area. 

The velocity  \\(\langle v \rangle_i\\) of each person
is defined as the length  \\(\Delta x\\) of the measurement area divided
by the time he or she needs to cross the area:

$$\langle v \rangle_i=\frac{\Delta x}{t_{\rm out}-t_{\rm in}},$$

where  \\(t_{\rm in}\\) and  \\(t_{\rm out}\\) are the times a person enters 
and exits the measurement area, respectively.

The density  \\(\rho_i\\) for each person \\(i\\) is calculated as:

$$\langle \rho \rangle_i=\frac{1}{t_{\rm out}-t_{\rm in}}\cdot\int_{t_{\rm in}}^{t_{\rm out}} \frac{N^\prime(t)}{b_{\rm cor}\cdot\Delta x}dt,$$

where  \\(b_{\rm cor}\\) is the width of the measurement area while  \\(N^\prime(t)\\) is the number of person in this area at a time  \\(t\\).
