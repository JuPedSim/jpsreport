This page shows how to get profiles of density, velocity and specific flow.
Here is an example extracted from a T-Junction experiment: 

![T-junction]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Figue4-4-3.png)

## Run jpsreport

Run `JPSreport` as described in [getting fundamental diagram](2016-11-08-fd.html).  

In order to calculate the profiles it is mandatory to use [method D](2016-11-07-method-d.html).  
Moreover, Set the parameter `enabled` of profiles to `true`.  
Set the resolution of the profile by initializing the  two parameters `grid_size_x`and `grid_size_y`, e.g.:  

```xml
<method_D enabled="true"> 
   <profiles enabled="true" grid_size_x="0.20" grid_size_y="0.20"/> 
</method_D> 
```

## (optional) Steady state

Determine the steady state of the experiment in the whole measurement region. 
In the folder script there is a script to fulfill this task semi-manually.  

## Produce the profiles

 Run the python script `_Plot_profiles.py`, which is in the scripts folder in `JPSreport`.
