# JPSreport v0.7
================

## Running
=======

>> ./JPSreport.exe ./xxx/xxx/ini_bottleneck.xml"

From the command line trajectory files mentioned in the inifile will be analysed by using the methods and parameters in the inifile.
The output results will be saved in the sub-folder of the folder where the inifile exists.

## Added

- Added four demos as examples for using JPSreport
- Added the option for specifying the location of scripts in configuration file.
- Embedded python scripts (**\_Plot_N\_t.py**, **\_Plot_timeseries\_rho_v.py**) for plotting N-t diagram (Method A), time series of density/velocity diagram (Method C and D) and Voronoi diagrams (Method D).
- Added python script (**SteadyState.py**) for automatically detecting steady state of pedestrian flow based on time series of density and velocity. When plotting fundamental diagrams normally only data under steady state are used due to its generality.
- Added python script (**\_Plot_FD.py**) for plotting fundamenatl diagram based on the detected steady state.
## Changed

- Changed name of some variables in configuration file:

    **measurementAreas**                --->  **measurement_areas**
    
	**Length_in_movement_direction**	---> **length_in_movement_direction**
	
	**useXComponent**		            ---> **use_x_component**
	
	**useYComponent**		            ---> **use_y_component**
	
	**halfFrameNumberToUse**            ---> **frame_step**
	
	**timeInterval**	                ---> **frame_interval**
	
	**measurementArea**	                ---> **measurement_area**
	
	**outputGraph**	                    ---> **output_graph**
	
	**individualFDdata**	            ---> **individual_FD**
	
	**cutByCircle** 	                ---> **cut_by_circle**
	
	**getProfile** 		                ---> **profiles**
	
	**scale_x**			                ---> **grid_size_x**
	
	**scale_y**			                ---> **grid_size_y**
- Changed the data type of frame rate (fps) from integer to float

- Changed the way for dealing with pedestrian outside geometry. In old version JPSreport stops when some pedestrians are outside geometry but now it continue working by 
removing these pedestrians from the list.

- More than one sub rooms in one geometry can be analysed independently.
	
## Fixed
	
- Fixed bug for dealing with obstacles inside geometry.
