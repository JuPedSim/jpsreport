This project is mainly developed by a small group of researchers and students from [JÃ¼lich Research Center](http://www.fz-juelich.de/en) and [BUW](http://www.uni-wuppertal.de/).
However, you are kindly invited not only to use `JuPedSim` but also contributing to this project.
It does not matter if you are a researcher, student or just interested in pedestrian dynamics.


## New contributors

### First steps
* Clone/fork our `gitlab` repository

  ~~~
  git clone https://gitlab.version.fz-juelich.de/jupedsim/jpsreport.git
  ~~~

* Change to the developement branch and create a branch with your feature.

  ~~~
  git checkout developement 
  git checkout -b feature_name
  ~~~

* Assuming you are in the `jpscore` folder type 

  ```
  mkdir build && cd build 
  cmake .. 
  ```

* Download all [dependencies](2016-11-03-requirements.html and check the output of `CMake`
    
* If everything compiles fine, you are free to start. :-)

### Workflow
The branches **master** and **develop** are **protected**. You can **only push to your feature-branch.**  
Whenever you want to add a feature or fix an issue create a new feature-branch and only work on this branch.  
Once you finish your fixes/changes merge the branch `develop` in your branch.
Make sure all tests are running before merging and you provided new tests for your feature.
After doing that open a merge request.

If your fix/feature is accepted it will be merged into the develop-branch.

### Requesting features

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestions is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

 * Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
 * Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
 * Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
 * Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

If you want to support us by writing the enhancement yourself consider what kind of change it is:

- **Major changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our **dev mailing list** so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small changes** can be crafted and submitted to our repository as a **pull or merge request**.

Nevertheless open an issue for documentation purposes with the following template:

## Writing Code

### Coding style

In JuPedSim we try to code according to the *Stroustrup* style of formatting/indenting.
If you want (or have) to write code in JuPedSim you really **need** to respect that style.
This is important not just aesthetically but also practically. Diff commits are much more clearer and cleaner.

The code is formatted using the automatic formatter [astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html)  with the option `--style=stroustrup`:

> Stroustrup style formatting/indenting uses stroustrup brackets.
> Brackets are broken from function definitions only.
> Brackets are attached to everything else including
> namespaces, classes, and statements within a function, arrays, structs, and enums.
> This style frequently is used with an indent of 5 spaces.

Here is an **example:**

```c++
int Foo(bool isBar)
{
     if (isBar) {
          bar();
          return 1;
     } else
          return 0;
}
```

#### Tabs vs Spaces
This can be a long and religious discussion, to make it short *DO NOT* use tabs, just spaces.

Here are some hints to configure your editor in order to use the *stroustrup* style

- **Emacs**:

  Add this to your ```.emacs```
  ```shell
  (setq c-default-style "stroustrup" c-basic-offset 5)
  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
  ```
- **Vim**:

  Set in your config file these variables
  ```javascript
  :set autoindent
  :set cindent
  :set expandtab
  :set shiftwidth=5
  :set softtabstop=5
  ```

- **Eclipse**:
    Here is a [plugin](http://astyleclipse.sourceforge.net/) for astyle in eclipse.

- **Clion**: preferences -> Editor -> Code Style --> C++ --> predefined style --> Stroustrup.  See also following screen-shot.

### Unit tests

Testing should be enabled by `CMake` as follows:
```javascript
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..
```

After compiling (`make`) the tests can be called as follows:

```javascript
ctest
```

This will take some hours time (depending on your machine). Threfore, a quick testing could be used:
```javascript
ctest -R Boost
```

which run a limited set of compiled unit tests on the code.

## Writing a unit test
If you write a unit test the first lines in your file should be

```c++
#define BOOST_TEST_MODULE MyTest
#define BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK
#include <boost/test/unit_test.hpp>
#include classtotest.h

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(MyTestClass)
```

Then you can start implementing your test cases by using
```c++
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(MyTestCase) 
{
  ...
}
```

For each method or function you want to test you should write a new test case and give it a speaking name.

### Verification and validation

Besides unit testing, we use in JuPedSim python-driven tests for verification and validation purposes.
Several validation and verification tests for *JuPedSim* (jpscore) are defined in the following section (e.g. Rimea and NIST).
In order to make the nightly builds run automatically, consider the following steps, before adding new tests.
This procedure is also recommended to make simulations with several inifiles e.g. different seeds.

To write additional tests, create a directory under *Utest/*.


- Create in *./jpscore/Utest/* a new direct with a descriptive name. For
   example: */Utest/test\_case1/*
- Put in that directory an ini-file (referred to as "master-inifile")
   and all the relevant files for a simulation, e.g. geometry file, etc. In the master-inifile you can use python syntax
   
   Example:
```xml
   <max_sim_time>[3,4]</max_sim_time> 
   <seed>range(1, 10)</seed>
```
- run the script `makeini.py` with the obligatory option `-f`: Using the
    aforementioned example the call is:
```bash
   python makeini.py -f test_case1/inifile.xml
```

The Script is going to create two directories:
- test\_case/trajectories: Here live the simulation trajectories.
- test\_case/inifiles: and here the inifiles, that will be produced  based on the master inifile (in this case test\_case1/inifile.xml).
    Note, that the geometry file and the trajectory files are all relative to the project files in the directory *inifiles*.


- Write a runtest-script. Here you have to define the logic of your test. What should be tested? When does the file succeed or file? etc.

Your script has to start with the following lines:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
from sys import *
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.path[0])))
from JPSRunTest import JPSRunTestDriver
from utils import *
```

After including these lines you can write the test you want to perform for every ini-file generated from the makeini.py script.
The method signature must contain at least two arguments to receive the inifile and the trajectory file from the simulation.

```python
def runtest(inifile, trajfile):
```

You can also use more than these arguments like this:

```python
def runtest(inifile, trajfile, x, y, z):
```

If you need a more complex example of how to use more arguments for further calculations please see runtest_14.py.
If a test has to fail because an error occurs or a necessary condition is not fulfilled  you can simply exit the script by using something like

```python
if condition_fails: 
  exit(FAILURE)
```
Once you have written your test you have to make your script executable, so it has to contain a main function which calls the test:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  test = JPSRunTestDriver(1, argv0=argv[0], testdir=sys.path[0])
  test.run_test(testfunction=runtest)
  logging.info("%s exits with SUCCESS" % (argv[0]))
  exit(SUCCESS)
```
